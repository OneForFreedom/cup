# Back to business?

Okay.. I'm back for another week of cad. This time im making a cup? Let's see how far I get along with this

## Start!
Okay after an intense burm out/brainstorm, I've decided to make a mug of hot cocoa, along with that, I'll cad extra things, like a spoon, for example, or a plate. or extra marshmallows? Possibilities are endless!

I decided against having that normal cup dip, for stability or something. I didn't add it because it'll just overal just make 3d printing it just that one bit easier.

That's the cup done! I added a cool printable handle that doesn't need supports (I hope)

Took me 1.5 hrs

I started with the additions of tic tacs! I.. I.. I. mean marshmallows! They still look a bit unnatural, so ill have to fix that. :P

I'd say we move onto something more.. Melt in your mouth...

## FLAKE 99!
I made a flake 99 chocolate! Apparently it doesn't melt! Ts took me 1.5 hours because i had to spend 5 seconds at each sketch line because it kept freezing. I had to restart fusion once, but luckily fusion had kept a recovery drive, although I had to start again from halfway when I was nearly done :P

## 54 DOLLARS??!?!
I made a boojie looking plate, the type that would be used in a fancy restaurant. This took me once again, 30 mins to make.

I'm gonna make a travel mug! It should look cool hopefully!

## Merged!!
I merged all 44 marshmallows into one body, that means they all had lost their colour, so I had to recolour every. single. face. 
I did it quite fast (15 min)

You see, some bodies are missing, thats because they're merged with one part
