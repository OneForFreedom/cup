# Back to business?

Okay.. I'm back for another week of cad. This time im making a cup? Let's see how far I get along with this

## Start!
Okay after an intense burm out/brainstorm, I've decided to make a mug of hot cocoa, along with that, I'll cad extra things, like a spoon, for example, or a plate. or extra marshmallows? Possibilities are endless!

I decided against having that normal cup dip, for stability or something. I didn't add it because it'll just overal just make 3d printing it just that one bit easier.

That's the cup done! I added a cool printable handle that doesn't need supports (I hope)

Took me 1.5 hrs
